# phantom_US_toolbox
A toolbox for analyzing code from phantom ultrasound experiments

To install, make sure that you have Python downloaded. I use Anaconda as my Python manager, but there are plenty of options out there. Once you have Python downloaded, download this code package. In terminal (on Macs; Anaconda Powershell or equivalent on Windows), navigate to this folder's directory (cd /path/to/folder). Install the needed packages by running:

**pip install -r requirements.txt**

Open the US_GUI.py program and hit run. You should see the following:

Copy and paste the path to your tdms file into the box (on a Mac, you can get your file path by navigating to the file in Finder > option + right click > Copy __ as Path Name). **IMPORTANT: DO NOT CHANGE THE TDMS FILE NAME** This script has been designed to parse through the file name to extract the important information embedded into it. 

Click on "Parse File." You should see something similar to the following, where the values and names are replaced with your specific experimental parameters. The one exception (currently) is the input mV parameter may need to be manually input. I will look to resolve this bug in the future. Stay tuned for future updates ðŸ™Œ.

Confirm that all the data in the boxes is correct and click on "Analyze Data." After a moment (maybe a few moments, depending on the size of the file and your computer), you should see a new window, similar to the following:

Here you have the option to plot different slices of the scan. Select "Pressure" to see a pressure map, and/or "Intensity" to see an intensity map. Select XY or XY to see the respective views. **Note:** I am currently working on implementing a 3D plot option, to visualize the whole cigar shape but this is currently not supported. Selecting "Focal Point" will automatically show you the point of highest pressure/intensity, whereas all plotting locations will give you all the slices. Here's an example:

If you want a little more freedom to play around with the data, the data extraction functions are all in phantom_US_toolbox.py. I am currently considering a function to automatically calculate the derated intensities and to plot a 3D shape of the US beam (see Legon 2014 for an example of this), but these are currently not supported. Please feel free to reach out and ask me for questions about making the plots a little more publication ready; I may include this automatically in the future. For now, though, these provide a quick way to visually inspect the data. 

Cheers!
